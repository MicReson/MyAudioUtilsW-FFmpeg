# Some audio utilities wrappers using ffmpeg

## Audio Utilities :headphones:

Here are some audio utilities that I could be using.

- One is used for converting a WAV file to an MP3 with different levels of quality.
- Use for making stereo files into mono fiels.

## :bangbang: Prior Setup :desktop_computer:

- Download and install ffmpeg.
  - Using winget `winget install --name ffmpeg` or `winget install --id Gyan.FFmpeg`.
- Clone or downdload the repo and un the batch scripts.
- If no argument is given, it should show print a quick instruction on how to use it.
